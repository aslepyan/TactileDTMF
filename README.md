# Tactile DTMF
This is the repository for "Analog Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency Signaling for Scalable Tactile Skin with Automatic Data Compression and a Single-Wire Output" and contains:
1. The PCB design
2. Data Collection - Collects sensor data from the hardware setup.
3. Data Visualization - Visualizes sensor data.
4. Classification - Classifies objects based on the aDTMF and raster-scanned sensor data. Visualizes the classification results. 
5. Classification Speed Comparison - Compares the classification speed of aDTMF sensor versus raster-scanned sensor.
